  <h2>Defining Campus Life</h2>
    <p>This collection is an archived series of information, photographs, and other publications that are managed by the University. The nature of this archive is to document the day-by-day life that occurs within the University of Pittsburgh’s buildings and throughout the campus. The archive often notes the university’s physical presence in the area of Pittsburgh since its founding in 1787. Over time, the institution has moved from Pittsburgh Academy in the Golden Triangle to Observatory Hill, before settling in the Oakland neighborhood in 1909, where it has remained since. The materials capture key changes in the architecture, such as the implementation of Henry Hornbostel’s Acropolis plan, which featured Greek Revival Buildings like State Hall. It also shows the later shift under Chancellor John G. Bowman, who started the construction of the Cathedral of Learning, which has been the center and focal point of the campus since it was completed in 1937. The Pitt Campus Life collection contains a total of 674 items, the dates of which span from 1869 to 2011. The archive contains still images, texts, and mixed media. These materials focus on the physical structures, ceremonial events, and history of the university. Photographs in the archive depict structures such as the Cathedral of Learning and the Stephen Collins Foster Memorial. There are documents regarding the implementation of campus plans with construction. There are commencement programs detailing ceremonial events such as the Commencement of 1951 or the Commencement of 1967. Items are going over the programs honoring student and faculty achievements. It includes the Honors convocation programs from numerous years. The main contributor to the archive is through various specialized collections from the University of Pittsburgh. Some key collections include the University of Pittsburgh Historic Photographs, 1884-present, Center for Instructional Development and Distance Education (CIDDE), and the University of Pittsburgh Photograph Collection. The archive functions as a searchable database to allow access to the documented materials. This collection is one category within a large archival system. Its relationship is integral to the other aspects of the University of Pittsburgh’s history because of the campus life’s intrinsic connection to the other archives, such as student affairs, athletics, etc. </p>

  <h2>Preserving Tradition on Campus</h2>
    <p>The Pitt Campus Life archive contains significant value as a documentation of the University’s physical and ceremonial history. It preserves materials about building and events that are integral parts of the Pitt experience. It contains the architectural history of the campus, involving symbolic buildings such as the Cathedral of Learning, making these documents important for understanding the city’s environment and the institution’s landmark structures. It also documents the formal culture of the campus, going over the many years of Commencement ceremonies and Honors Convocations. This archive serves as an official consultation of the University’s “campus life”. The chosen materials dictate what is deemed important and memorable by the institution. The collection generates knowledge about physical growth, institutional stability, and formalized recognition. This information is valuable to historians, architectural planners, and other facilities on the campus. Much of the usage comes from administrators and departments that are responsible for managing the campus environment, such as the University of Pittsburgh. Facilities Management. Specialized researchers have also utilized the materials found in this archive, such as those working with the Jonas Salk Polio Vaccine Collection and those studying the French Nationality Room Committee Collection. However, the collection does exclude some information due to marginalization. It focuses heavily on the Oakland location of the university, offering little documentation on the satellite locations such as Johnstown or Greensburg. There are very few mentions of any student dissent or political movements in the collection. It also naturally excludes any undocumented or unofficial life of students and staff who do not pass through institutional publication or photographic channels. </p>

  <h2>Reframing the Archive</h2>
    <p>We should consider the nature and biases that the Pitt Campus Life archive inherits. We should address the archive’s bias towards physical infrastructure and formalized events. While it successfully documents “Pitt buildings and events, such as commencement and the honors convocation, that are integral parts of the Pitt experience”, it misses other crucial parts of the campus history. We should work to expand the scope of the collection to balance current strengths with underrepresented areas. We should collect and catalog more information regarding the satellite campuses, as the current collection heavily favors the Oakland location. We should document social change and student dissent to archive student activism, protest, and social movements. We should also make it clear that the archive is made up of a majority of administratively created content, and the collection represents the official institutional perspective of campus life. This archive strongly connects to and enhances existing knowledge of the architectural and formal academic tradition of the University of Pittsburgh. It also challenges the definition of “Integral Parts” of campus life. By using what is present and excluded from the collection, we can use that information to challenge the dominant narrative that is presented by the archive. The archive also brings into question how the design and construction of the campus impacts the curriculum design or administration. What do the underrepresented parts of this collection look like? Is there a certain visual narrative that is being constructed by the images created by institutional photographers? </p>
